This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  The `getInitialURL()` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This leads to unexpected behavior because the app doesn't recognize the deep link and fails to route to the correct screen. The issue is inconsistent, making debugging and reproducing the problem difficult.
